Our Scottish Heritage

Our beautiful Scottish heritage
Far in the distance as it may be
Comes to us most suddenly
Oh, how happy are we!

Those men in kilts
How strong they be
Far flung these logs
Success! Oh, how happy are we!

Oh them that play on those divine fiddles
Played with joy and vibrancy
Delight in their eyes as their tunes carry heaven-ward 
Oh, how happy are we!
