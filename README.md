# Celtic-Poem
This is a repo is for Celtic poems


The poems should reflect the culture of the seven Celtic nations in traditions, arts, history, or literature. Personal anecdotes of family, studies, or travelling experiences are also great additions. 

Because I am of Scottish heritage, I will include poems that reflect the Scottish culture in a varity of ways.
