# Celtic-Poem
This is a repo is for my Celtic poem 


The poem(s) should reflect the culture of the seven Celtic nations in traditions, arts, history, or literature. Personal anecdotes of family, studies, or travelling experiences are also great additions. 

Because I am of Scottish heritage, I will include poems that reflect the Scottish culture in a varity of ways.
