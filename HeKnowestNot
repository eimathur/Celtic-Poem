He Knowest Not - a poem by Zara 

Some sayest he's from Ãˆirinn
Others sayest he's from isle an duine
But he knowest not whence he's from
He wandered the land and asked daoine
Some sayest he's from Caoga
Other sayest he's from Cornwall
But he knowest not whence he's from  
Until one day he asked a sheanmhair  
Which land dost she erred from
Hast she erred from An Brittany? Or Galicia?
He knowest not
Nay sayest she, I be, but-a proud from Alba!
And now, finally he knows that which he knewest not
